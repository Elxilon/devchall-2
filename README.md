      Where can I see your demo?

- What was your experience?

  I experiment for the first time the grid display and sass on this project. Not the best approach, but I'm glad it works. The only thing I used to help me was finding on the internet, the "writing-mode" properties to set it vertical.

  In few years, I'll enjoy to see my "beginner works" ! :)

- What have you learned/improved?

  In addition, to the "writing mode" properties, I forced myself to use SASS. I recognize we can do better stuff with this, I'll continue to perform myself using SASS better and better each time ! :)
